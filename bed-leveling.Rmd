## Intro

The Monoprice control panel lets you level (or more accurately, tram) the bed w/the `BUILD-PLATE` choice. However, there's _no_ option to check the bed level.

I want to check the levelness before any adjustments are made.  The peritent details extracted from the G-code are:

```{c, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#define LEVELING_OFFSET 0.1				// Assumed thickness of feeler gauge/paper used in leveling (mm)
```

```{c, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
code for leveling points used by build-plate menu option
```

## 0.004" (0.1mm) Setting

Include some photos

Include photo of nozzle

The filament accumulation on the nozzle suggests that 0.004" is not enough clearance.  When the hotend was hot, 200C, and the nozzle clean, a 0.001" feeler gauge was thin enough to slip between the nozzle and bed.  

## 0.006" (0.15mm) Setting
