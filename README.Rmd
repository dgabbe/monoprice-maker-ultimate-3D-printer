## Monoprice Maker Ultimate 3D Printer MK11 Direct Drive Extruder / 24V Power System

Notes on setup/configuration for this Wanhao Duplicator 6 clone. Interestingly, it appears the Wanhao firmware is used in the Monoprice.  The manual also uses this name "Maker Select Pro Ultimate 3D" for the printer.  Specific experience with an open box model is [here](./open-box-experience.md).

* Name: Monoprice Maker Ultimate 3D Printer, MK11 direct drive extruder / 24V power system.
* Rear tag: Monoprice Maker Select Pro Ultimate 3D Printer
* Part no: 15710
* Firmware: DEV 3.01
* Processor: Arduino Mega 2560 (as reported by System Info)

Status when unpacked:

* Machine on: 21:06
* Printing: 7:05
* Material: 12m

## Tools

* [1mm feeler gauge](https://www.mcmaster.com/2283a26)
* [0.004" feeler gauge](https://www.mcmaster.com/20385a34)
* 9mm 1/4" socket w/speed thumb wheel on ratchet
* Smooth jaw pliers
* [0.015" dia High-Speed M2 Tool Steel Rod](https://www.mcmaster.com/3009a297) for unclogging nozzle. Will compare effectiveness to sewing needle.

## Filaments

See [filaments.md](./filaments.md) for settings and experience with different materials.

## Profiles

See [profiles.md](./profiles.md) saved printer profiles which include stock and custom ones.

## Printer Settings & Tuning

_Likely to move to its own page_

The build leveling function does not offer a way to cancel out once started. There is no built-in feature to review the bed levelness.

## Calibration

Anytime a piece of your printing environment changes, a recalibration of your printer is needed. If a phyical component is changed, **always** check the bed level.  If the filament is changed, checking the temperatures and extrusion number is well advised. 

### Steps:

Easiest to start with PLA filament because it's the most forgiving.

1. Check build level using the printer's LCD menu option
1. <<Select a slicer program - add more details>>
1. Create a slicer profile based on Monoprice's info ![settings](./images/slicer-settings.png).

## Slicers & Firmware

The *slicer* is the software needed to turn a 3D model into G-code.  The printer's *firmware* translates the G-code into control signals which drive the printer's different parts.

### Firmware

The Monoprice uses
[Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/introduction.html#what-is-marlin?). Official support was added in ??build-get-reference??.

### Slicers

{fill-in}

## G-code Details

There are variations in how each printer implements G-code. See [RepRap](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code) for the reference specification.  Refer to 
[this page](https://marlinfw.org/meta/gcode/) for Marlin specifics.
