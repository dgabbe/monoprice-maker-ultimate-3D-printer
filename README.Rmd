## Intro

I'm trying a Git/markdown combo for all the info about setting up, checking, and using this printer with the notion that our teenager could learn a few aspects of software development.

## The Printer

The printer's full name is _Monoprice Maker Ultimate 3D Printer MK11 Direct Drive Extruder / 24V Power System_.

Notes on setup/configuration for this Wanhao Duplicator 6 clone which is a clone of the Ultimaker 2. Interestingly, it appears the Wanhao firmware is used in the Monoprice.  The manual also uses this name "Maker Select Pro Ultimate 3D" for the printer.  Specific experience with an open box model is [here](./open-box-experience.md).

* Part no: 15710
* Name: Monoprice Maker Ultimate 3D Printer, MK11 direct drive extruder / 24V power system.
* Rear tag: Monoprice Maker Select Pro Ultimate 3D Printer
* Processor: Arduino Mega 2560 (as reported by MacOS System Info)
* Firmware flavor: [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/)
* Firmware version: DEV 3.01
* Firmware source: The Wanhao firmware kept the Ultimaker strings in the `language.h` file.
    * Wanhao: https://github.com/garychen99/Duplicator-6-firmware-version-3.1
    * From M115 G-code: https://github.com/Ultimaker/Ultimaker2Marlin
* G-codes implemented: https://github.com/garychen99/Duplicator-6-firmware-version-3.1#implemented-g-codes

The manuals are:

* [Monoprice manual](https://downloads.monoprice.com/files/manuals/15710_Manual_160622.pdf)
* [Wanhao manual](http://www.wanhao3dprinter.com/xiazai/D6_User_Manual_REV_A.pdf). The Wanhao manual is easier to understand than the Monoprice one.

## Maintenance Tools

* [1mm feeler gauge](https://www.mcmaster.com/2283a26)
* [0.004" feeler gauge](https://www.mcmaster.com/20385a34)
* 9mm 1/4" socket w/speed thumb wheel on ratchet
* Smooth jaw pliers
* [0.015" dia High-Speed M2 Tool Steel Rod](https://www.mcmaster.com/3009a297) for unclogging nozzle. Will compare effectiveness to sewing needle.

## 3D Filaments

See [filaments.md](./filaments.md) for settings and experience with different materials.

## Profiles

See [profiles.md](./profiles.md) saved printer profiles which include stock and custom ones.

## Printer Settings & Tuning

_Likely to move to its own page_

### Bed Leveling and Z Axis 0

The build leveling function does not offer a way to cancel out once started. There is no built-in feature to review the bed levelness.  You can do this with g-code {add details from my file}.

To-do list:

* https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/7264/how-to-set-the-z-home-offset


## Calibration

Anytime a piece of your printing environment changes, a recalibration of your printer is needed. If a phyical component is changed, **always** check the bed level.  If the filament is changed, checking the temperatures and extrusion number is well advised. 

### Steps:

Easiest to start with PLA filament because it's the most forgiving.

1. Check build level using the printer's LCD menu option
1. <<Select a slicer program - add more details>>
1. Create a slicer profile based on Monoprice's info [![settings](./images/slicer-settings-thumb.png)](./images/slicer-settings.png).

### Notes on Building a Profile

_This section is a work-in-progress_

Both Cura and PrusaSlicer offer a couple of different ways to store settings for future use.

PrusaSlicer only provides profiles for its own printers.  Here are some notes on how I made ones for the Monoprice.

1. Fine tuning hotend temperature, this [Temperature Tower](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2092820) was sliced and then the g-code edited to insert the commands to change the temperature. All files are [here](https://github.com/dgabbe/3D-test-objects/tree/master/TempTower).

To-do list:

* See Configuration.h for feed, speed, and acceleration values starting at line 364. `m501` will read the EEPROM values.
* Add details from https://hackaday.com/2016/08/30/review-monoprice-maker-ultimate-3d-printer/ around speeds.  The position precision in the X and Y axes are 12.5 micron, in the Z is 5 micron. Suggested settings: x/y acceleration: 2K - 3K mm/sec2 print speed: 100mm/sec (down from 150mm/sec). Limiting factor is if the hotend can deliver enough filament.  At 300mm/sec and 0.1mm layer height the extruder started stripping the filament.

* Errata: 1000 micron (micrometer) = 1mm; 1 micron = 0.001mm
* Layer resolution: Ultra high: 20 micron; High: 60 micron; Medium: 100 micron; Low: 200 micron

## Slicers & Firmware

The *slicer* is the software needed to turn a 3D model into G-code.  The printer's *firmware* translates the G-code into control signals which drive the printer's different parts.

### Slicers

* Info on customizing Cura w/[definition files](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/wiki/Definition-Files-Explained)
* Details for [PrusaSlicer](http://projects.ttlexceeded.com/3dprinting_prusaslicer.html) and https://forum.prusaprinters.org/forum/english-forum-general-discussion-announcements-and-releases/prusaslicer-ini-docs/
* [PrintRun tutorial](https://all3dp.com/2/printrun-a-beginner-s-tutorial/) - may need to move out of this section.

## G-code Details

There are variations in how each printer implements G-code. See [RepRap](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code) for the reference specification.  Refer to 
[this page](https://marlinfw.org/meta/gcode/) for Marlin specifics. [G-code viewer](https://github.com/hudbrog/gCodeViewer).
