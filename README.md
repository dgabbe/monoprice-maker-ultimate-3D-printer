Monoprice Maker Ultimate 3D Printer MK11 Direct Drive Extruder / 24V Power System
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes on setup/configuration for this Wanhao Duplicator 6 clone.
Interestingly, it appears the Wanhao firmware is used in the Monoprice.
The manual also uses this name “Maker Select Pro Ultimate 3D” for the
printer.

Printer Settings & Tuning
-------------------------

*Likely to move to its own page*

The build leveling function does not offer a way to cancel out once
started. There is no built-in feature to review the bed levelness.

Calibration
-----------

Anytime a piece of your printing environment changes, a recalibration of
your printer is needed. If a phyical component is changed, **always**
check the bed level. If the filament is changed, checking the
temperatures and extrusion number is well advised.

### Steps:

Easiest to start with PLA filament because it’s the most forgiving.

1.  Check build level using the printer’s LCD menu option
2.  &lt;&lt;Select a slicer program - add more details&gt;&gt;
3.  Create a slicer profile based on Monoprice’s info
    ![settings](./images/slicer-settings.png).

Slicers & Firmware
------------------

The *slicer* is the software needed to turn a 3D model into G-code. The
printer’s *firmware* translates the G-code into control signals which
drive the printer’s different parts.

### Firmware

The Monoprice uses
[Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/introduction.html#what-is-marlin?).
Official support was added in ??build-get-reference??.

### Slicers

G-code Details
--------------

There are variations in how each printer implements G-code. See
[RepRap](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code) for the reference
specification. Refer to [this page](https://marlinfw.org/meta/gcode/)
for Marlin specifics.
