printer_notes = 5/24/2020: Created w/Configuration Assistant.\n  Printer: MonoPrice Ultimate Maker 2 3D\n    - Nozzle size: 0.4mm; Filament Ø: 1.75mm; Stock machine configuration. \n    - Use this profile to generate other MonoPrice printer settings.\n    - X axis may not be full 200mm of travel. Set to 199mm which is what my printer is. \n    - Z axis may not be full 175mm of travel. Set to 170mm which is what my printer is.\n    - Added scanned image of bed PEI sheet.\n    - Unchecked 'Supports stealth mode' because Trinamic steppers were not used.\n\n5/24/2020:\n    - Parameter: retract_length[0]: 4.  Previous value was 2. Printer's firmware value is 4.5mm.  See if it improves minor retraction issues seen in prints.\n    - Parameter: machine_max_feedrate_x[0]: 100. Previous value was 500. https://hackaday.com/2016/08/30/review-monoprice-maker-ultimate-3d-printer/ recommended 100mm/sec\n    - Parameter: machine_max_feedrate_y[0]: 100. Previous value was 500. See above comment\n    - Parameter: machine_max_acceleration_x[0]: 2000. Previous value was 9000. Encountered layer shifting on 4" long print. Could hear very different noise from printer on these fast moves when the layer shifted.\n\n5/26/2020:\n    - Parameter: max_machine_jerk_x[0]: 8. Previous value was 10. Change based on Ender & i3 MK3 settings.\n    - Parameter: max_machine_jerk_y[0]: 8. Previous value was 10. Change based on Ender & i3 MK3 settings.\n\n
5/27/2020:\n    - Changed values based on diff w/i3 MK3.\n\n
