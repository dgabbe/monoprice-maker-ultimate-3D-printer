Material Types
--------------

PLA warps less and can be printed on an unheated surface (3M Blue Tape
2090). It is also a harder plastic, it has less flexibility than ABS and
when it breaks it tends to shatter. PLA prints at about 180 degrees C
and has a sweet smell (like burned sugar/waffles). PLA also prints
wonderfully to either plain glass or Kapton heated to 60c.

PLA Plus

PETG

ABS prints best on a heated surface, kapton over aluminum or glass are
popular choices. Without heat abs will curl up and ruin the print. ABS
has a bit more flexibility than PLA. It prints between 200 and 230
degrees C and the smell bothers some people.
