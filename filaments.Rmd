## Material Types

**PLA** warps less and can be printed on an unheated surface (3M Blue Tape 2090). It is also a harder plastic, it has less flexibility than ABS and when it breaks it tends to shatter.  PLA prints at about 180 degrees C and has a sweet smell (like burned sugar/waffles). PLA also prints wonderfully to either plain glass or Kapton heated to 60c.

**PLA Plus** <<fill-in>>

**PETG** <<fill-in>>
  
**ABS** prints best on a heated surface, kapton over aluminum or glass are popular choices.  Without heat abs will curl up and ruin the print.  ABS has a bit more flexibility than PLA. It prints between 200 and 230 degrees C and the smell bothers some people.
